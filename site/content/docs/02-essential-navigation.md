# Essential Navigation Commands

Now that you understand the basics, let's expand your navigation vocabulary with commands for moving around the screen efficiently.

## Directional Navigation

Beyond the basic left/right movement, VoiceOver provides comprehensive directional control:

### Primary Movement

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Move to next item | **VO + Right Arrow** |
| Move to previous item | **VO + Left Arrow** |
| Move up | **VO + Up Arrow** |
| Move down | **VO + Down Arrow** |

The up and down arrows' behavior depends on context:
- In lists and tables, they move between rows
- In text, they move between lines
- In some views, they navigate vertically through items

### Jumping to Boundaries

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Move to first item in area | **VO + Home** |
| Move to last item in area | **VO + End** |
| Move to top of window | **VO + Shift + Home** |
| Move to bottom of window | **VO + Shift + End** |

On laptops without Home/End keys, use:
- **VO + Fn + Left Arrow** for Home
- **VO + Fn + Right Arrow** for End

### Moving to Visible Boundaries

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Move to visible top | **VO + Shift + Left Arrow** |
| Move to visible bottom | **VO + Shift + Right Arrow** |

These commands move to the first or last visible item without scrolling, useful for quickly scanning what's currently on screen.

## Reading Commands

VoiceOver offers multiple ways to have content read to you:

### Continuous Reading

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Read all from cursor | **VO + A** |
| Stop reading | **Control** |

**VO + A** starts reading continuously from the current position to the end of the content. VoiceOver moves the cursor as it reads.

### Reading Specific Items

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Repeat last phrase | **VO + Z** |

The ability to copy the last spoken phrase is incredibly useful—you can paste it into documents, search fields, or messages.

When the application switcher appears:

## Summary

You now have a comprehensive set of navigation commands:

- **Directional movement** with VO + Arrow keys
- **Boundary jumping** with VO + Home/End
- **Continuous reading** with VO + A
- **Information commands** with VO + F3 through F7
- **System navigation** to Menu Bar (VO + M), Dock (VO + D), and Desktop (VO + Shift + D)
