# The VoiceOver Rotor

The Rotor is one of VoiceOver's most powerful features—a virtual dial that provides quick access to lists of page elements, navigation options, and settings. Mastering the Rotor will dramatically speed up your navigation.

## What Is the Rotor?

Think of the Rotor as a multi-purpose menu system that:
- Lists all elements of a specific type (headings, links, etc.)
- Lets you jump directly to any element
- Provides filtering to find specific items
- Changes navigation behavior

## Opening the Rotor

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Open Rotor | **VO + U** |

When you press **VO + U**, the Rotor appears with a list of items. The first list you see depends on context—on a webpage, it's typically Links or Headings.

## Navigating the Rotor

Once the Rotor is open:

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Switch categories (next) | **Right Arrow** |
| Switch categories (previous) | **Left Arrow** |
| Move through items | **Up/Down Arrow** |
| Select item and jump | **Return** or **Space** |
| Close without selecting | **Escape** |

### Example Workflow

1. Press **VO + U** to open Rotor
2. Press **Right Arrow** until you hear "Headings"
3. Press **Down Arrow** to hear each heading
4. Press **Return** on the heading you want
5. VoiceOver jumps to that heading and closes the Rotor

## Rotor Categories for Web Pages

On webpages, the Rotor can show:

| Category | Contains |
|----------|----------|
| Links | All links on the page |
| Visited Links | Links you've previously clicked |
| Non-Visited Links | Links you haven't clicked |
| Headings | All headings (H1-H6) |
| Form Controls | Text fields, buttons, checkboxes, etc. |
| Tables | All tables |
| Landmarks | ARIA landmarks and regions |
| Frames | Page frames |
| Images | Images and graphics |
| Auto Web Spots | Significant elements detected automatically |
| Web Spots | Custom locations you've marked |

## Filtering Rotor Items

You can type while in the Rotor to filter items:

1. Open Rotor (**VO + U**)
2. Navigate to desired category
3. Start typing to filter

### Examples

- In **Headings**, type "2" to show only H2 headings
- In **Links**, type "contact" to show links containing "contact"
- In **Form Controls**, type "search" to find search fields

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Clear filter | **Delete** |

## Getting More Information

While in the Rotor, you can get additional details about items:

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Hear item's help tag | **VO + Shift + H** |
| Hear link URL | **VO + Shift + U** |

This helps you evaluate items before selecting them.

## Customizing the Web Rotor

You control which categories appear and their order:

1. Open VoiceOver Utility (**VO + F8**)
2. Click **Web** category
3. Click **Web Rotor** tab
4. Check/uncheck items to include
5. Use **Command + Up/Down Arrow** to reorder

Tip: Put your most-used categories first so you can access them quickly.

## The Rotor in Applications

The Rotor isn't just for web pages—it also works in applications:

### Application Rotor Categories

| Category | Contains |
|----------|----------|
| Window Spots | Custom locations in the window |
| Characters | For character-by-character navigation |
| Words | For word-by-word navigation |
| Lines | For line-by-line navigation |
| Content Chooser | Context-specific options |

### Using Content Chooser

Content Chooser adapts to your current context. For example, in Mail:
- Preview messages while staying in the message list
- Move between message parts (headers, body)

## The Quick Nav Rotor

When Quick Nav is enabled (covered later), there's a separate Quick Nav rotor:

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Open Quick Nav Rotor | **Up + Left Arrow** or **Up + Right Arrow** |

This rotor changes how arrow keys navigate—by headings, links, or other elements.

## Rotor Tips and Tricks

### Tip 1: Learn the Category Order

Categories appear in a consistent order. Memorize which direction to press to reach your frequent categories.

### Tip 2: Type to Filter Immediately

As soon as you navigate to a category, start typing your filter—no need to press anything special first.

### Tip 3: Use Rotor for Exploration

On an unfamiliar page, use the Rotor to:
- Count how many headings/links exist (shown in category name)
- Survey all form controls before filling out a form
- Find all images and their descriptions

### Tip 4: Escape Is Your Friend

Press **Escape** anytime to close the Rotor without navigating away from your current position.

### Tip 5: Combine with Quick Search

If you know exactly what you want:
1. Open Rotor
2. Go to appropriate category
3. Type the first few characters
4. Press Return on the first match

This is often faster than pressing **VO + Command + [letter]** repeatedly.

## Table Rotor

When navigating tables, the Rotor provides table-specific options:

- Navigate by rows
- Navigate by columns
- Jump to headers

Access this by opening the Rotor while focused on a table.

## Summary

The Rotor is essential for efficient navigation:

- **VO + U** opens the Rotor
- **Left/Right Arrow** switches categories
- **Up/Down Arrow** navigates items
- **Return** or **Space** selects and jumps
- **Type** to filter items
- **Escape** closes without action
- Customize categories in VoiceOver Utility

Practice using the Rotor on various websites. Once it becomes second nature, you'll find yourself navigating pages much faster than with element-by-element commands alone.
