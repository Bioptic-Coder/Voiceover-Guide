# Hot Spots and Window Spots

Hot Spots and Window Spots let you mark frequently accessed locations for instant navigation. These powerful features save time when you regularly need to jump to specific controls or areas.

## Hot Spots

Hot Spots are global bookmarks—they work across applications and persist between sessions.

### Setting Hot Spots

You can create up to 10 Hot Spots (numbered 0-9):

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Set Hot Spot | **VO + Shift + [0-9]** |

To set a Hot Spot:
1. Navigate to the item you want to bookmark
2. Press **VO + Shift + [number]** (e.g., **VO + Shift + 1**)
3. VoiceOver confirms: "Hot spot 1 set"

If that number is already used, the new location replaces the old one.

### Jumping to Hot Spots

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Jump to Hot Spot | **VO + [0-9]** |

Press **VO + 1** to jump to Hot Spot 1, **VO + 2** for Hot Spot 2, and so on.

### Hot Spot Information

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Describe Hot Spot | **VO + Command + [0-9]** |
| Monitor Hot Spot changes | **VO + Command + Shift + [0-9]** |

**Describe Hot Spot** tells you what's at that location without jumping to it.

**Monitor Hot Spot** watches for value changes and announces them automatically—useful for monitoring download progress, stock prices, or other dynamic content.

### Hot Spot Chooser

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Open Hot Spot Chooser | **VO + Shift + X** |

The Chooser shows all your Hot Spots in a list:
1. Navigate with **Up/Down Arrow**
2. Press **Return** to jump to selected Hot Spot
3. Press **Escape** to cancel

### Removing Hot Spots

To remove a Hot Spot:
1. Jump to it (**VO + [number]**)
2. Set it again (**VO + Shift + [number]**)

Since you're setting it to the same location, you can also set it to a different location to effectively "move" it.

### Hot Spots with Activities

If you use VoiceOver Activities, each activity gets its own set of 10 Hot Spots. This means you can have different Hot Spots for different contexts.

## Window Spots

Window Spots are bookmarks within a specific window. They help you quickly scan or jump to important areas of complex interfaces.

### Creating Window Spots

Window Spots are managed through the Rotor:

1. Navigate to the location you want to mark
2. Press **VO + U** to open Rotor
3. Navigate to **Window Spots** category
4. You can add the current location to Window Spots

Or navigate to an existing Window Spot and update it.

### Using Window Spots

1. Open Rotor (**VO + U**)
2. Navigate to **Window Spots** category
3. Use **Up/Down Arrow** to navigate your spots
4. Press **Return** to jump to one

### When to Use Window Spots

Window Spots are ideal for:
- Complex application windows (like DAWs or IDEs)
- Dashboards with multiple data areas
- Web pages you visit regularly
- Any window where you need to quickly check multiple locations

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Monitoring a Download

1. Start a download
2. Navigate to the progress indicator
3. Press **VO + Shift + 1** to set Hot Spot 1
4. Press **VO + Command + Shift + 1** to monitor it
5. VoiceOver announces progress changes automatically

### Example 2: Quick Access to Dock Apps

1. Press **VO + D** to go to Dock
2. Navigate to Mail
3. Press **VO + Shift + 2** to set Hot Spot 2
4. Navigate to Safari
5. Press **VO + Shift + 3** to set Hot Spot 3

Now press **VO + 2** to jump to Mail, **VO + 3** for Safari.

### Example 3: Dashboard Monitoring

In an application with multiple data areas:
1. Navigate to first data area
2. Set Hot Spot 1
3. Navigate to second area
4. Set Hot Spot 2
5. etc.

Now you can quickly cycle through data areas with VO + 1, 2, 3...

### Example 4: Complex Window Navigation

For an app like Logic Pro or Xcode:
1. Set Window Spots for timeline, mixer, library, inspector
2. Use Rotor > Window Spots to jump between them
3. Build muscle memory for your most-used areas

## Tips for Hot Spots and Window Spots

### Tip 1: Plan Your Hot Spots

Reserve certain numbers for certain purposes:
- 1-3: Current project locations
- 4-6: Frequently used apps
- 7-9: Temporary monitoring

### Tip 2: Use Monitoring Sparingly

Monitoring too many Hot Spots can be distracting. Turn off monitoring (press the command again) when you no longer need updates.

### Tip 3: Combine with Activities

Create activities for different workflows, each with appropriate Hot Spots:
- Email activity: Hot Spots for inbox, compose, folders
- Web research activity: Hot Spots for search, articles, notes
- Coding activity: Hot Spots for editor, terminal, documentation

### Tip 4: Document Your Hot Spots

Keep a mental or physical note of your Hot Spot assignments, especially when starting out. The Hot Spot Chooser (**VO + Shift + X**) can remind you.

### Tip 5: Window Spots for Web Pages

For complex web applications you use regularly (like web email), set Window Spots for:
- Navigation menu
- Main content area
- Compose button
- Search field
